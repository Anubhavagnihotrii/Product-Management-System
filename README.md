# Product-Management-System


The Product Management System is a software application that facilitates the management and organization
of product-related information using a file storage approach. **Instead of relying on a traditional database
system, the system leverages file storage as a means to store and retrieve product data.** The system enables
businesses to efficiently track and maintain information about their products, including details such as name,
description, price, quantity, and any additional attributes. <br/>
By implementing the Product Management System with file storage, businesses gain flexibility and simplicity in managing their product data. **The system eliminates the need for a complex database setup and offers a lightweight solution for small to medium-sized product catalogs**. Additionally, the file-based approach allows for easy integration with other systems and simplifies data sharing across different platforms.

##  Concept and Functions

**The system provides functionalities to create, read, update, and delete product records within these files**,
enabling seamless management of product information. The files serve as containers for storing product data
in a structured manner. Users interact with the Product Management System through a user-friendly interface
that allows them to perform various operations on the stored product data.<br/> 
These operations include 
- adding new products, 
- modifying existing product details, 
- removing products, and 
- retrieving product information.
